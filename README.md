# Weather-Data-Analysis-using-Python-
Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in our daily lives, enabling us to plan our activities and make informed decisions. In the realm of Data Science, weather forecasting utilizes time series data and advanced algorithms to predict weather conditions for specific locations and timeframes.

# Introduction:
Weather patterns have a significant impact on our daily lives. In this file, we will use Python to analyze and forecast weather trends in Delhi. By leveraging powerful libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and statsmodels, we will gain insights into temperature, humidity, wind speed, and their relationships over the years.

## Important Requiremnets 
1. VS code editor
2. Latest version of python
3. libraries : PANDAS, NUMPY, PROPHET, MATPLOTLIB, SEABORN, STATSMODELS, PLOTLY . 



## Importing and Describing the Data:
We begin by importing the necessary libraries and reading the weather dataset, which is stored in a CSV file. Using the `head()` function, we get a glimpse of the dataset, displaying the first few rows. Then, by employing the `describe()` function, we obtain statistical summaries of the data, including count, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.

## Exploring the Data:
Next, we dive deeper into the dataset by examining the information about all the columns. This step provides us with a better understanding of the data types and non-null counts.

## Visualizing Mean Temperature Over the Years:
Using the plotly express library, we create an interactive line chart that showcases the mean temperature in Delhi over the years. The x-axis represents the date, while the y-axis represents the mean temperature. This visualization enables us to observe temperature trends and patterns.

## Analyzing Humidity Over the Years:
Similarly, we create another line chart using plotly express to visualize the humidity in Delhi over the years. This visualization helps us gain insights into the variations and changes in humidity levels.

## Investigating Wind Speed Over the Years:
Continuing our exploration, we utilize plotly express to generate a line chart that depicts the wind speed in Delhi over the years. By examining this visualization, we can identify any noteworthy patterns or anomalies.

## Understanding the Relationship Between Temperature and Humidity:
To analyze the relationship between temperature and humidity, we create a scatter plot using plotly express. This visualization showcases the correlation between these two variables. Additionally, we include a trendline using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship.

## Analyzing Temperature Change:
To gain insights into the temperature change over time, we transform the date column into a datetime data type. Then, we extract the year and month values. By utilizing seaborn and matplotlib, we create a line plot that illustrates the temperature change in Delhi over the years. This visualization allows us to observe the annual variations and identify trends.

## Weather Forecasting using Prophet:
For weather forecasting, we employ the Facebook Prophet model. Before applying the model, we rename the columns in the dataset to match the Prophet's required format. We then fit the model, create future timestamps, and generate predictions for the mean temperature using the `make_future_dataframe()` and `predict()` functions.

## Conclusion:
In this file, we explored weather trends in Delhi using Python. By analyzing and visualizing temperature, humidity, wind speed, and their relationships, we gained valuable insights into the weather patterns. Additionally, we utilized the Facebook Prophet model to forecast future mean temperatures. This analysis enhances our understanding of weather forecasting techniques and empowers us to make informed decisions based on weather data.
